How Reliable Is the Democracy-Climate Nexus? A Multi-Index Robustness Analysis of Per-Capita CO₂ Emissions
Author: Muhammad Muinul Islam

Inconsistent evidence on whether democracy curbs greenhouse-gas emissions stems in part from scholars’ reliance on single democracy measures and narrow model choices. This study places robustness at the center of inquiry, systematically re-examining the democracy–climate nexus with six leading democracy indices, V-Dem, Polity IV, Freedom House, EIU, BTI, and Przeworski across a balanced panel of 120 countries covering 1990-2018. We apply a triangulated econometric toolkit that combines panel-corrected standard errors, fixed-effects, and random-effects within-between (REWB) estimators, thereby stress-testing results against alternative specifications, measurement designs, and distributional assumptions. Conceptually, we go beyond prior confirmatory work by separating structural democracy - a country’s long-run democratic average - from dynamic democratization, the year-to-year shifts that existing research usually conflates. This distinction underpins a novel hypothesis on the limited short-term climate returns from rapid democratization.
Using a Random-Effects Within-Between (REWB) framework, we uncover a clear pattern: structural democracy - each country’s long-run democratic average predicts lower per-capita CO₂ emissions across all six indices, whereas dynamic year-to-year democratization has no short-term effect. Stratified analyses reveal a pronounced income gradient: high-income democracies achieve the steepest emission declines, whereas low-income democracies display negligible change, reflecting resource and capacity constraints. These patterns endure after extensive sensitivity checks, exclusion of outliers, and lagged-variable tests, underscoring the consistency of the findings.
The results temper expectations of an automatic “democratic dividend” and indicate that participatory governance lowers emissions only when reinforced by adequate economic and institutional capacity. Effective climate strategies should therefore couple democratic accountability with targeted fiscal support and administrative strengthening to unlock democracy’s full mitigation potential.
